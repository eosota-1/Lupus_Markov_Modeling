Importance : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disproportionately affects Black women in the United States at higher rates and severity than the general population. Biologics are the newest treatment category for SLE, presenting greater efficacy with lower side effects, and our study seeks to evaluate their cost-effectiveness in this high-risk population. 

Objective: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of biologics (Belimumab or Anifrolumab) in combination with standard of care (SOC) of glucocorticoids compared to SOC alone for the treatment of moderate-to-severe SLE in Black women in the United States. 

Methods: We developed a Markov model with five health states (remission/mild, moderate, severe, organ damage, and death) and a six-month cycle length to simulate the disease progression and treatment effects over a lifetime horizon. We derived the transition probabilities from U.S. registries and clinical trials and stratified by race-specific hazard ratios. Our model incorporated both direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective. Outcomes included total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. 
 
Results: SOC remained the most cost-effective strategy. Compared to SOC, Anifrolumab + SOC increased QALYs by 0.69 but exceeded the U.S. willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold with an ICER of $195,814/QALY. Belimumab + SOC was more expensive and less effective than Anifrolumab, resulting in strong dominance. Sensitivity analysis identified the cost of Anifrolumab as the most influential parameter and requires a price reduction of 14.25% (from $22,430.46 to $19,234 per 6-Month supply) to meet the WTP threshold. 

Conclusion: Over a lifetime horizon, Belimumab and Anifrolumab improve clinical outcomes for Black women with moderate-to-severe SLE, but neither is cost-effective at the current cost of treatment. Anifrolumab demonstrated the most effectiveness in terms of QALY but would require a price reduction to be economically viable compared to SOC. These findings signify the need for equitable pricing policies and the importance of considering demographic disparities in SLE treatment strategies.
